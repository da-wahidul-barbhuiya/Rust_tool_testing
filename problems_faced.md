# Using test-driven developement process(TDD) for helps for checking  all function output passing or failing
* Testing every function or methods implementation is great way of checking whether your funciton is going correct or not .
* Some time it's very difficult if there is not bug related to any functoin , then this TDD comes to play as one can check individually for every funciton pass of fail.

# Importance of using traits in rust
* From my project's point of view, I first introduced trait when I was testing my function as unit test and now passing another funciton inside that finction of test module.
* As command line project , I created a struct for passing two arguments , one is file I/O handling and second arg is for time frame passing, now these commands are linked directly to the every methods implemented inside impl block , for every method implementation it will act as a seperate object inside the trait which is easy for implementing in other places.
* Using trait object it is easily to pass trait object in different places.
